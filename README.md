## How it works
You don't have to be a genius. Just click on start, take a picture of your sandwich, and see how much it scores.

## How it should work
Eventually (maybe not) I will include an image recognition API, so I can tell if there's actually a sandwich in your picture. Also, it has a bug on Android that you have to go 
all the way back to the home screen to take another picture. I'll probably fix that later (or not).

## Give it a try!
If you have an Android device, you can download the APK [right here](https://apkfab.com/sandwichapp/com.samuellmiller.sandwichapp/apk?h=d011c3c4ef4245899f8e8aa151b01136952055d3217d655e7bc0c178d7fc9221). If you have an iOS, you just can't lol.
You can also clone this repo like this:

```
# Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/samuelmarina/sandwich-rater.git
$ cd sandwich-rater
```

And then just run it
```
# Install required packages
$ yarn install || npm install

# Run Expo
$ expo start

# Press a for Android emulator, or i for iOS simulator
# Or run it in your device using the other Expo options (e.g. QR code)
```

This project is made to be part of my series called "Useless Apps", not meant to be serious, but just useless. They're fun, but probably they don't work too well.
